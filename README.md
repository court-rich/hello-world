# hello-world
My Newbie Play-space

I'm Courtney and I am new to GitHub. So far I like it! I've only recently learned about this through a data visualization course I am taking and I wish I worked through this tutorial in advance. Super simple and things do not seem as foreign anymore. This is my first repo. :)
